/* When to use malloc()
You know how many bytes you want, and you donâ€™t care about the initial contents.

You plan to immediately fill or overwrite the memory anyway.

You want a slight performance boost, because malloc() is usually a bit faster (doesn't zero memory).

Example: reading data from a file or user input right after allocation. */
